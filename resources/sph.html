            <h1>smoothed particle hydrodynamics.</h1>

<p>this has been adapted from chapter 2 of my phd thesis.</p>

<p>smoothed particle sydrodynamics (SPH) was initially born out of the
    drive to study astrophysical problems that do not have spherical
    symmetry. indeed it is in this regime where many of the most interesting
    problems reside. this was the motivation for the invention of SPH,
    introduced ,independently, by both <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/181.3.375" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gingold &amp; mongahan 1977</a> and <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977AJ.....82.1013L/abstract" target="_blank">lucy 1977</a>. the
    standard way of solving the equations of fluid dynamics is on a grid,
    computing derivatives via finite difference or finite volumes methods.
    The grid method has been applied extensively in the context of
    astrophysics. however, by their very nature, problems in astrophysical
    fluid dynamics span a vast range in time, space, and density; this
    requires a great deal of adaptability from numerical methods, something
    standard grid methods lack. much effort has been put into solving this
    issue with the development of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), though the
    implementation of this is far from trivial. in addition to technical
    difficulties these methods are prone to numerical diffusion due to the
    grid itself.</p>
    <p>the SPH method replaces the grid with a set of particles, which are
    used as a set interpolation points from which the properties of the
    fluid can be calculated. it is an intuitive and elegant solution. As SPH
    is fully Lagrangian the particles move with the density distribution of
    the fluid as it evolves. this means that SPH has adaptive resolution
    built into it; denser regions have better resolution and no
    computational effort is being wasted on regions in which there are no
    particles. the advantages of this being that no knowledge of which
    regions will require high resolution is need beforehand and no
    complicated mesh refinement needs to take place. SPH also benefits from
    its ability to use free boundaries, which crop up in a wide variety of
    astrophysical problems, with relative ease. all SPH equations can be
    derived from physical principles with few basic assumptions it is
    straightforward to add complicated physics to SPH schemes.</p>
    <p>this is not to say that SPH is perfect. whilst physics is, in
    principle, straightforward to add into SPH scheme it is often
    challenging in practice due to numerical issues to do with
    instabilities. there is an additional computational cost due to the
    requirement to build neighbour lists. the SPH method which i use uses 
    a binary tree to determine neighbours of particles and to
    calculate the gravitational forces. the positioning of the particles
    themselves also causes issues. initial conditions in SPH are very
    important and usually require some trial and error to get right, as
    setups that are not appropriate to the problem can lead to unexpected
    results. for a much more thorough read, see the reviews of <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1992ARA%26A..30..543M/abstract" target="_blank">mongahan 1992</a>

    <h1 id="sph-fundamentals">SPH Fundamentals </h1>
    <h2 id="interpolation-theory">Interpolation Theory</h2>
    <p>the basis of SPH is interpolation theory. as mentioned above the
    points of interpolation are the particles, from which any value can be
    expressed.</p>
    <p>a scalar variable \(A(\mathbf{r})\) is
    defined as $$A(\mathbf{r}) = \int
    A(\mathbf{r}')\delta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}'$$ where \(\delta\) is the dirac delta function. this
    can be approximated by replacing \(\delta\) with a smoothing kernel \(W\) with a width \(h\) where, $$\label{eq:kern_to_dirac}
        \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} W(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}',h) =
    \delta(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}').$$ this gives $$\label{eq:interp_basis}
        A(\mathbf{r}) = \int A(\mathbf{r}')W(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}')\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}' +
    O(h^2)$$ where \(W\) has
    the property</p>
    <p>$$\label{eq:kern_norm}
        \int_V W(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}',h)\mathrm{d}V = 1.$$ with this Eq. <a
    href="#eq:interp_basis" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="eq:interp_basis">[eq:interp_basis]</a> can be expressed
    as a sum over the interpolation points</p>
    <p>$$\begin{aligned}
        \langle A(\mathbf{r}) \rangle &amp;= \int \frac{A(\mathbf{r}')}{\rho
    \mathbf{r}'} W(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}',h)\rho(\mathbf{r}')\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}' +
    O(h^2)\label{eq:sph_interp_int}\\
        &amp;\approx \sum_j^{N_\text{neigh}} m_j
    \frac{A_j}{\rho_j}W(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}',h),\label{eq:sph_interp_sum}
    \end{aligned}$$where the mass element \(\rho dV\) has been replaced with
    the mass of the particle \(m\),
    \(N_\text{neigh}\) is the
    number of neighbours and \(j\) is
    the neighbour particle index. This summation over discrete points is
    central to SPH formalism, and can be used to interpolate a quantity
    \(A(\mathbf{r})\) at a point in space \(\mathbf{r}\) that is defined in terms of
    quantities of the particles, e.g. \(\rho\), \(m\). The calculation of gradient terms
    follows simply by taking the derivative of Eq. <a
    href="#eq:sph_interp_int" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="eq:sph_interp_int">[eq:sph_interp_int]</a> $$\begin{aligned}
        \nabla A(\mathbf{r}) &amp;= \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{r}} \int
    \frac{A(\mathbf{r}')}{\rho(\mathbf{r}')}
    W(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}',h)\rho(\mathbf{r}')\mathrm{d}\mathbf{r}' + O(h^2),\\
        &amp;\approx \sum_j m_j
    \frac{A_j}{\rho_j}\nabla_i{W(\mathbf{r}_i-\mathbf{r}_j,h)}.
    \end{aligned}$$</p>
    <h2 id="smoothing-kernels">Smoothing kernels</h2>
    <p>Any kernel used in SPH must satisfy Eqs. <a href="#eq:kern_to_dirac"
    data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="eq:kern_to_dirac">[eq:kern_to_dirac]</a> and <a
    href="#eq:kern_norm" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="eq:kern_norm">[eq:kern_norm]</a>. The original kernel
    <span class="citation"
    data-cites="gingold_sph_1977MNRAS.181..375G"></span> was the Gaussian
    and in 3D takes the form $$W(r,h) =
    \frac{1}{\pi^{3/2}h^3}\exp{-q^2},$$ where \(r = \vert \mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}' \vert\), and \(q= r/h\). This has
    the advantage of being spatially everywhere differentiable, which is
    good for stability. But it also spans the entire spatial domain, which
    is causes a needless waste of computing time as contributions from
    particles become rapidly insignificant.</p>
    <p>It is far more advantageous to define a kernel with compact support,
    i.e. a truncation radius. Since <span class="citation"
    data-cites="monaghan_refined_1985"></span> one of the most common kernel
    is the M4 cubic spline <span class="math display">$$W(r,h) =
    \frac{\sigma}{h^\nu} \begin{cases}
            1 - \frac{3}{2} q^2 + \frac{3}{4} q^3 &amp; \text{if}\ 0 \leq q
    &lt; 1,\\
            \frac{1}{4} (2 - q)^3 &amp; \text{if}\ 1 \leq q &lt; 2,\\
            0 &amp; \text{else},
        \end{cases}$$</span> where ν is the number of dimensions, and
    σ</em> = [2/3, 10/7<em>π</em>, 1/<em>π</em>]</span>
    are the normalisation factors in each dimension. This kernel has compact
    support over <span class="math inline">2<em>h. Whilst this
    has the advantage of reduced computation requirements it comes at the
    cost of reduced accuracy. Usually the cubic kernel is sufficient for
    most problems in SPH, sometimes a kernel with a larger compact support
    is needed, for example when including dust in calculations. Such a
    kernel is the M6 quintic kernel <span class="math display">$$W(r,h) =
    \frac{1}{120 \pi h^3} \begin{cases}
        (3-q)^5 - 6(2-q)^5 + 15(1-q)^5, &amp; \text{if } 0 \leq q &lt; 1,\\
        (3-q)^5 - 6(2-q)^5 , &amp; \text{if } 1 \leq q &lt; 2, \\
        (3-q)^5, &amp; \text{if } 2 \leq q &lt; 3, \\
        0 &amp; \text{otherwise},
        \end{cases}$$</span> this has compact support up to <span
    class="math inline">3<em>h and gives virtually identical
    results as the Gaussian in most problems.</p>
    <h2 id="smoothing-length">Smoothing length</h2>
    <p>The term smoothing length refers to the scale over which forces and
    physical properties of particles are smoothed out over. This is where
    SPH gets its name, physical properties are smoothed out using a kernel
    function. A key principle is to keep the number of neighbours that a
    particle has roughly constant; for the usual cubic spline, for example,
    this is <span class="math inline"> ≈ 60</span>. This is so that any
    region of the fluid can be well represented. As a consequence of the
    Lagrangian nature of SPH keeping the number of neighbours of any given
    particle roughly constant mean that each particle must have its own
    smoothing length that is able to vary. The smoothing length of a
    particle <span class="math inline"><em>i in 3D can be
    defined as <span class="math display">$$h_i = \eta \left(
    \frac{m_i}{\rho_i} \right)^{(1/3)},$$</span> where η is used to set the number of
    particles for every particle. To obtain about <span
    class="math inline">60</span> neighbours using a cubic spline η</em> = 1.2</span>. The choice of value of
    <span class="math inline"><em>η is important as it can lead
    to the pairing instability, where the distribution of particles becomes
    unstable and particles can fall on top of each other.</p>
    <h1 id="fluid-equations">Fluid Equations</h1>
    <p>Now that the theory of SPH has been laid out the equations of
    hydrodynamics can be solved. It is pertinent to re-state that SPH is in
    the Lagrangian frame of reference, as such derivative take the form
    <span class="math display">$$\dv{A}{t} = \pdv{A}{t} +
    \mathbf{v}\cdot\grad{A},$$</span> where \(\mathbf{v}\) is the velocity of the fluid. This
    gives the flow rate of a property, A, for a fluid as a function of
    space and time, opposed to the Eulerian which gives the rate of flow in
    fixed space.</p>
    <h2 id="continuity-equation">Continuity equation</h2>
    <p>Using Eq. <a href="#eq:sph_interp_sum" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="eq:sph_interp_sum">[eq:sph_interp_sum]</a> the density
    of particle <span class="math inline"><em>i is <span
    class="math display"><em>ρ</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> = ∑<sub><em>j</em></sub><em>m</em><sub><em>j</em></sub><em>W</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub>(<em>h</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>).</span>
    Taking the derivative of this yields <span
    class="math display">$$\label{eq:sph_cont}
        \dv{\rho_i}{t} = \sum_j m_j (\mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{v}_j) \cdot \grad_i
    W_{ij}(h_i).$$</span> The continuity equation is the differential form
    of the conservation of mass of a system defined as <span
    class="math display">$$\label{eq:cont_eq}
        \pdv{\rho}{t} + \rho \div{\mathbf{v}} = 0,$$</span> meaning that the
    rate of change of mass within a fixed volume equals the rate of flow
    through the boundaries of that volume.</p>
    <p>To derive the SPH form of the continuity equation the golden rule of
    SPH must first be applied, that is to rearrange the continuum equation
    such that the operators are acting on the density. Applying this golden
    rule to Eq. <a href="#eq:cont_eq" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="eq:cont_eq">[eq:cont_eq]</a> gives <span
    class="math display">$$\pdv{\rho}{t} + [ \div{\rho \mathbf{v}} - \mathbf{v}
    \cdot \grad{\rho} ] = 0.$$</span> Then applying the summation
    interpolants and rearranging gives <span
    class="math display">$$\begin{aligned}
        \pdv{\rho_i}{t} &amp;= \mathbf{v}_i \sum_j m_j \cdot \grad{W_{ij}(h_i)}
    - \sum_j m_j \mathbf{v}_j \cdot \grad{W_{ij}(h_i)},\\
        &amp;= \sum_j m_j (\mathbf{v}_i - \mathbf{v}_j) \cdot \grad_i W_{ij}(h_i),
    \end{aligned}$$</span> which is identical to Eq. <a href="#eq:sph_cont"
    data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="eq:sph_cont">[eq:sph_cont]</a>. Therefore the continuity
    equation can be replaced by either Eq. <a href="#eq:sph_dens"
    data-reference-type="ref" data-reference="eq:sph_dens">[eq:sph_dens]</a>
    or Eq. <a href="#eq:sph_cont" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="eq:sph_cont">[eq:sph_cont]</a>.</p>
    <p>The remainder of the SPH algorithm can be derived from just Eq. <a
    href="#eq:sph_dens" data-reference-type="ref"
    data-reference="eq:sph_dens">[eq:sph_dens]</a> and the first law of
    thermodynamics, using a variational principle. This is a wonderful fact
    as this means that SPH obeys conservation laws exactly.</p>
    <h2 id="sec:eom">The Lagrangian</h2>
    <p>The Lagrangian of hydrodynamics is <span class="citation"
    data-cites="eckart_1960"></span> <span class="math display">$$L = \int
    \left( \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 - \rho u  \right)\mathrm{d}V,$$</span> where
    <span class="math inline"><em>u is the internal energy per

    <p>The reality of finding a particle’s neighbour is very computationally
    expensive and scales as O</em>(<em>N</em><sup>2</sup>)</span> without
    any optimisation. The code used in this work, <span
    class="smallcaps">sphNG</span>, uses a binary tree structure originally
    described in <span class="citation"
    data-cites="press_binary_1986"></span> to compute gravity and to find
    neighbours, this improves efficiency of neighbour finding to O</em>(<em>N</em>log <em>N</em>)</span>. All
    particles (leaves of the tree) that share a nearest mutual neighbour are
    paired, the properties of which are combined into a node. All other
    particles go through the same process until the final two nodes are
    paired with the root node. To find the neighbours for particle i the tree is walked, ignoring nodes
    with a sphere of influence that does not fall within the truncation
    radius of particle <span class="math inline"><em>i.</p>
    <p>The same tree is used to calculate the gravitational force on any
    given particle. For particles at a distance greater than <span
    class="math inline">2<em>h gravitational forces can be
    computed using the combined contribution of particles, i.e. the nodes
    themselves. The gravitational forces over these long ranges are
    calculated using the gravitational monopole and quadrupole terms of
    distant nodes. All nodes that are within the kernel radius are opened to
    particle level and the gravitational forces are computed directly. The
    nodes outside the kernel radius with size to distance ratio h</em>/<em>r</em> &gt; 0.3</span> are opened

    interpolation points that represent a continuous distribution of fluid.
    Fluid mass contained in overlapping regions represented by these points
    needs to be accounted for, otherwise the gravitational forces calculated
    will be too high as this shared mass will counted multiple times. In
    these cases it is necessary to use a gravitational softening scheme. The

    <p>The presence of shocks in numerical hydrodynamics leads to
    discontinuities in the fluid as the numerical method can not resolve
    down to the scale of the mean free path of the gas. In a real fluid
    kinetic energy is dissipated into heat due to an inherent viscosity. As
    this viscosity can not be resolved by the numerical method but must be
    accounted for, an artificial viscosity is included. Viscous terms are
    added to the fluid equations as was suggested by <span class="citation"

    <h1 id="time-stepping">Time stepping</h1>
    <h2 id="time-integration">Time integration</h2>
    <p>The <span class="smallcaps">sphNG</span> code uses a second-order
    Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg integrator <span class="citation"
    data-cites="fehlberg1969low"></span> to evolve the difference equations
    to be solved. In this scheme the first step is to evaluate the rate of
    change quantity \(\mathbf{A}\) <span
    class="math display">$$k_0 = \dot{\mathbf{A}}(t_n, \mathbf{A}_n),$$</span> where
    <span class="math inline"><em>n denotes the timestep
    counter. The quantity \(\mathbf{A}_n\) is
    predicted at a half timestep \(\mathbf{A}_{n+1/2}\) and the derivatives are
    re-evaluated as <span class="math display">$$k_1 = \dot{\mathbf{A}} \left(
    t_n + \frac{\Delta t}{2}, \mathbf{A}_{n+1/2}  \right),$$</span> k</em><sub>1</sub></span> is the predicted
    gradient of \(\mathbf{A}\) at a half
    timestep. An improved estimate of the derivatives are calculated using a
    weighted average of k</em><sub>0</sub></span> and k</em><sub>1</sub></span>, this additional
    accuracy is why the Fehlberg intergrator is second-order even though
    strictly speaking it is a first-order integrator. The result is <span
    class="math display">$$\mathbf{A}_{n+1} = \mathbf{A}_n + \left( \frac{1}{256}
    k_0 + \frac{255}{256} k_1 \right) \Delta t.$$</span></p>
    <h2 id="setting-timesteps">Setting timesteps</h2>
    <p>An essential constraint in any numerical differential equation solver
    is to satisfy the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, which
    determines the hydrodynamic timestep. The CFL timestep is defined as
    <span class="math display">$$\Delta t_{\text{CFL}} = C_{\text{CFL}}
    \left( \frac{h}{v_{\text{sig}}} \right)$$</span> where v</em><sub>sig</sub></span> is the signal
    velocity and <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub>CFL</sub></span>
    is the Courant number, set to 0.3 in <span
    class="smallcaps">sphNG</span>.</p>
    <p>In addition to the CFL constraint there is also a force constraint
    which is calculated from the ratio of smoothing length to acceleration
    magnitude \(\mathbf{\left\vert \mathbf{a}
    \right\vert}\) <span class="math display">$$\Delta t_\text{F} =
    C_\text{F} \sqrt{\frac{h}{\left\vert \mathbf{a}\right\vert}}$$</span> where
    <span class="math inline"><em>C</em><sub>F</sub></span> is set to 0.3.
    Under this condition particles with a high acceleration are given
    shorter timesteps to maintain accuracy.</p>
    <p>In a purely hydrodyanamical calculation these two conditions suffice.
    When adding in additional physics there may be a requirement to include
    additional constraints on the timesteps. The timestep for a particle
    <span class="math inline"><em>i is set by taking the minimum
    value of all timestep constraints that are necessary, for example in the
    purely hydrodynamical case <span
    class="math display"><em>Δ</em><em>t</em><sub>min</sub> = min (<em>Δ</em><em>t</em><sub>CFL</sub>, <em>Δ</em><em>t</em><sub>F</sub>).</span></p>
    <h2 id="individual-timesteps">Individual timesteps</h2>
    <p>To save on computational expense all particles are each given their
    own timesteps <span class="citation" data-cites="bate_thesis"></span> .
    For particles in low density regions it is sufficient to take long
    timesteps to achieve the required numerical accuracy, whereas for
    particles in high density regions short timesteps are needed. In
    practice individual particle timesteps are set into timestep bins. In
    advance of a calculation a maximum timestep, Δ</em><em>t</em><sub>max</sub></span>, is chosen
    and divided by powers of two, upto <span
    class="math inline">2<sup>30</sup></span> meaning that the smallest
    timestep bin is <span class="math inline"> ≈ 10<sup>9</sup></span> times
    smaller than Δ</em><em>t</em><sub>max</sub></span>. In
    addition to this particles that share a timestep are evolved together
    along with particles with other timesteps if they are smaller or if they
    are a multiple of their timestep.</p>
    <h2 id="sink-particles">Sink particles</h2>
    <p>As density increases, timesteps decrease. At the point when a
    protostar forms calculations effectively stop due to the very small
    timesteps required at the location of the protostar. As the interiors of
    these objects are not of interest in calculations studying discs, all
    the particles that make up the protostar are replaced by a single,
    non-gaseous, massive particle with the combined mass, linear momentum
    and spin of the particles it replaces. Infalling material can be
    accreted by the particle, alleviating the need for small timesteps. This
    massive particle is referred to as a sink particle <span
    class="citation"
    data-cites="bate_sink_particles_1995MNRAS.277..362B"></span>. The idea
    has been use previously in finite-difference grid codes to study
    collapsing clouds past the point of protostellar core formation <span
    class="citation"
    data-cites="boss_collapse_1982 boss_protostellar_1987"></span>, however
    these central cells were fixed, the sink particles in SPH can move
    around.</p>
    <p>The sink particles interact with other particles only via gravity.
    Particles that come within a certain radius of the sink particle, r</em><sub>acc</sub></span> may be accreted if
    some criteria are satisfied. The accretion radius is set before a
    calculation is begun and remains at that value throughout the
    calculation. Typically an accretion radius is set depending on the
    resolution desired about a sink particle. The first criterion of
    accretion is that a particle must be bound to the sink. Second, the
    specific angular momentum of the particle must be less than required for
    it to form a circular orbit at the accretion radius about the sink.
    Finally, the particle must be more tightly bound to that sink than to
    other sink particles.</p>
    <h2 id="planets-with-surfaces">Planets with surfaces</h2>
    <p>In this thesis i make use of the planetary model of <span
    class="citation" data-cites="ayliffe_gas_2009"></span>. In this setup,
    planetary cores are modelled with a gravitational potential. The method
    of <span class="citation" data-cites="ayliffe_gas_2009"></span> has been
    adapted to allow for the use of a gravitational potential to be used in
    a global disc simulation rather than in a disc section. The main benefit
    of this model that accretion can be modelled down onto the planet core,
    allowing the formation of a planetary atmosphere. In order to build this
    gas atmosphere, gravity is modified near the planet surface. The
    gravitational potential approaching the surface from outside gradually
    shallows, and then rapidly increases inside this surface to prevent
    particle penetration. The gravitational force take the form <span
    class="math display">$$F_r = - \frac{GM_\text{c}}{r^2} \left( 1 - \left(
    \frac{2R_\text{p} - r}{R_\text{p}}\right)^4 \right),$$</span> for r</em> &lt; 2<em>R</em><sub>p</sub></span> where
    <span class="math inline"><em>r is the radius from the
    centre of the planetary core, R</em><sub>p</sub></span> is the radius of the
    planet core, and <span class="math inline"><em>M</em><sub>c</sub></span>
    is the core mass. This results in a net zero force between a particle
    and the planet core at a radius of R</em><sub>p</sub></span>. Inside the core
    radius the force is outwards and increases with decreasing radius. As a
    result, particles come to rest close to the core radius. As more
    particles become bound to the planet core they layer upon top of the
    inner layer of particles, this gradually forms the planetary atmosphere.
    Using this method allows for natural growth of a planet, self-gravity,
    and radiative transfer.</p>
    <h2 id="radiative-transfer">Radiative transfer</h2>
    <p>With the inclusion of radiative transfer the equations of
    hydrodynamics must be reformulated. This work uses the flux-limited
    diffusion of <span class="citation"
    data-cites="whitehouse_2005MNRAS.364.1367W"></span>, their method
    implements the radiation hydrodynamics equations of <span
    class="citation" data-cites="mihalas_foundations_1984"></span>. In
    solving the radiation hydrodynamic equations it is useful to redefine
    the specific gas energy into the gas energy density, e</em> = <em>u</em><em>ρ. In the
    formulation the continuity equation remains the same as in
    hydrodynamics. The momentum equation now must include radiation pressure
    <span class="math display">$$\rho \frac{D\mathbf{v}}{Dt} = - \nabla P +
    \frac{\chi_\text{F} \rho}{c} \mathbf{F},$$</span> where χ</em><sub>F</sub></span> is the flux mean total
    opacity, and \(\mathbf{F}\) is the momentum
    density flux. The time dependence of the radiation energy density is
    <span class="math display">$$\rho \frac{D}{Dt} \left(\frac{E}{\rho}
    \right) = - div{\mathbf{F}} - \nabla \mathbf{v}:\mathbf{P} + 4 \pi \kappa_\text{P}
    \rho B - c \kappa_\text{E} \rho E,$$</span> where κ</em><sub>P</sub></span> and κ</em><sub>E</sub></span> are the Planck mean
    and energy mean absorption opacities, respectively, B is the Planck function, and E is the radiation energy density.
    The first and second terms on the right hand side are the diffusion of
    the radiation flux and the work done on the radiation field. The third
    and fourth terms are the interaction between the radiation and gas
    fields. The evolution of the gas energy is as follows <span
    class="math display">$$\rho \frac{D}{Dt} \left( \frac{e}{\rho}\right) =
    - P \div{\mathbf{v}} - 4 \pi \kappa_\text{P} \rho B + c \kappa_\text{E} \rho
    E.$$</span> The SPH implementation of these equations and the method
    used to solve them can be found in the work of <span class="citation"
    data-cites="whitehouse_2005MNRAS.364.1367W"></span>. In addition to
    this, the work presented makes use of the thermal evolution model of

    data-cites="bate_keto_10.1093/mnras/stv451"></span> to allow for more
    accurate treatment of thermal behaviour of molecular clouds at low

    thermodynamics of a diffuse ISM with radiative transfer in the
